Hey yall! This is a simple tool for importing levels from https://deepnight.net/tools/led-2d-level-editor/. I'm VERY new to writing things like this, and welcome contributions. It's probably very buggy as of this initial release, so let me know if you run into any problems

Make sure that the relpath in your json file is just the name of the image you use for a tileset, and place that image in the folder alongside the importer.gd

As of now, it should support at minimum a single tileset, autolayers, and tilegrid layers. IntGrids on their own will do nothing, and I haven't begun working on entities yet. If you have questions feel free to reach out to me at aaboaf@gmail.com and I'll do my best to walk you through using the tool.
